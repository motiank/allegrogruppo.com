Do you offer a public API for online orders (create order, update status)?”

“Do you provide a hosted checkout / iframe for card-not-present payments with a payment URL or token?”

“Can we inject orders into the POS from an external web app?”

“What are your webhooks for payment/fulfillment statuses?”

“Do you support CORS and frame-ancestors for embedding from https://www.eatalia-market.co.il/?”


Use the beecom api readme file and create a router named beecomm  in a file named beecomm.js.
the router will provide the following entry points:
post /beecomm/pelecard/placeorder : this entry point will be called by pelecard servers 
(it will be the ServerSideGoodFeedbackURL) it will validate with pelecard  that the order is good 
(add the validate function to pelecard.js and export it) and the struct the order and push it to beecomm.
get /beecomm/getmenu : this entry points wil return a pretty json html of the complete menu with all neccassry details.

all credentials , and ids (like restreuant id etc) will be set in the .env files.
