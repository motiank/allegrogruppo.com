# CLAUDE.md — hq/ (Joya HQ)

Joya HQ: the AI headquarters of the Allegro group's restaurants, https://hq.allegrogruppo.com (planned). A separate
service in the Allegro repo (port 4300, own `package.json`, own phone app), next to `admin/`, `order_sys/`, `events/`.
The AI runner is `runner/`. Moved here from the tradewit repo on 2026-10-24.

Read `README.md` first — layout, data model, learning rules, permissions, deploy.

Rules for this folder:
- **Never develop or test against the production DB.** The repo-root `.env` points at the production `allegro`
  DB; `hq/.env.local` must point `DB_*` at a local MySQL. The smoke test and the eval-context script refuse
  any other host.
- **Logins are the Allegro admin users** (repo-root `users.json`). Joya only reads that file, never writes it,
  and checks passwords with the admin's `userApi.getUserKey`. Never copy the hashing code here.
- **No source data is stored here.** Sales, dish sales, employees, clock times and payroll come from the admin
  Local Data API through `src/services/source.js` only (never a new `joya_*` copy). Joya's tables hold only
  Joya's own records, linked to Allegro ids. A missing API is asked from the admin (`../local_api_readme.md`).
- Do not change admin code from here (`admin/` has its own uncommitted work); ask the owner, or write a prompt for
  the admin session.
- Keep the five kinds of data apart (source, recommendation, manager edit, approved decision, execution).
- Every string in both `client/i18n/*.he.js` and `*.en.js` (same keys). Hebrew is the default; RTL; phone first,
  boxes not tables. The main menu has three chat areas (stock and purchasing, manpower, performance).
- Numbers the AI shows come from `src/services/ai.js` calculations, never from the model. After a prompt change
  (`runner/hq-analyst.js`) run `npm run eval`. Model calls go through `claude -p` (subscription), never an API key.
- SQL: single-quoted strings (ANSI_QUOTES-safe). Logger: pino (`lib/log.js`).
- Tests: `npm test`, `npm run test:runner`; smoke test against a LOCAL DB with `scripts/fake-allegro.mjs` as the
  API (README → Tests). Commit only `hq/` files (and what the owner asks), conventional commits.
